# Anamoly Detection with Continous Learning Algorithm

In this project we compare a continous learning algorithm HTM and deep learning model LSTM autoencoder for the task of Anomaly Detection in Autonomous Driving datasets. The dataset we used were  VeReMi dataset, a reference dataset that can be used for misbehaviour frameworks and data Carrera track which we collected ourselves.
