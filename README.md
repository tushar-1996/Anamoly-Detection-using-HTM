# Anamoly Detection with Continous Learning Algorithm

In this project we compare a continous learning algorithm HTM and deep learning model LSTM autoencoder for the task of Anomaly Detection in Autonomous Driving datasets. The dataset we used were  VeReMi dataset, a reference dataset that can be used for misbehaviour frameworks and data Carrera track which we collected ourselves.

- Investigated a learning-based method HTM for anomaly detection on our custom time-series dataset.
- Generated the dataset from a Carrera track and recorded the control signals like position, speed, acceleration etc.
- Performed various types of network attacks on cars in a platoon to cause accidents.
- Predicted Attacks using HTM and LSTM based architecture.
